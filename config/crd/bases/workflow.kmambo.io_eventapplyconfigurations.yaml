              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                  don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                  intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.
